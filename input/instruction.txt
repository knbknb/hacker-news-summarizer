You will be provided with meeting notes about a topic, from various participants. 
Your task is to summarize the arguments of each participant in a markdown table.  
Summarize the arguments of each note. Use short sentences. For longer sentencesa, fall back to keyword-style, with max 50 keywords.

For formatting the output, provide a markdown table:

- Participant/User name | Argument |  Argument comment/objections/questions (keyword-style)/URLs

If there is a "chunk_number" argument in the input, and it is 0, then include a header in the output.
 if it is larger than 0, do not include a markdown table header.

Some info about the input format: 
Contribution Topics are separated by <author></author>:<comment></comment>  

If URLs are mentioned in the comments, include them in the 3rd column.  
Short URLS, such as those with a length of thess than 50 characters should be output as they are.
 Longer URLs should be output in markdown format [...](https://...)' with a reasonable label/linktext [] . 
 You can take the path fragment or if this is incomprehenesible (e.g. a random string), use the domain name.
If there is no URL in a comment by a participant, leave the 3rd column empty.
