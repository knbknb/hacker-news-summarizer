You will be provided with meeting notes about a topic, from various participants. 
Your task is to summarize the arguments of each participant in a markdown table.  
Summarize the arguments of each note. Use short sentences. For longer sentencesa, fall back to keyword-style, with max 50 keywords.

For formatting the output, provide a markdown table:

- Participant/User name | Argument |  Argument comment/objections/questions (keyword-style)/URLs

Some info about the input format: 
Contribution Topics are separated by ---|---|---  with some optional whitespace, including newline characters.
User names can be found in lines containing a substring  matching  the regex '^\s*\[\d+\]\w+'  . 
If no username is obvious, write (unknown). 
If URLs are mentioned, include them in the 3rd column. URLs are given in markdown format [...](https://...)'; include only the raw url. 
If there is no URL in a meeting note by a participant, leave the 3rd column empty.
