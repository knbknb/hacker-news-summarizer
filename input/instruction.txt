You will be provided with meeting notes about a topic, from various participants. 
Your task is to summarize the arguments of each participant in a markdown table.  

For formatting the output, provide a markdown table. 
If there is a "<tableheader>" line at the beginning of the input, then do not include this in your response 
and  provide this table header, given here in markdown format:

| Participant/User name | Argument |  Argument objections(keyword-style)/URLs |

If there is no "<tableheader/>" argument at the beginning of the input, 
then assume the header has already been provided and start with the participant's name.   

Some info about the input format: 
Contribution Topics are separated by <author></author>:<comment></comment>  
Summarize the arguments of each note. Use short sentences. For longer sentences, fall back to keyword-style, with max 50 keywords.
If a comment does not contain valuable information (e.g. "thank you", "Big fan of X", ...), omit that author and comment.

If URLs are mentioned in the comments, include them in the 3rd column.  
Short URLS, such as those with a length of thess than 50 characters should be output as they are.
 Longer URLs should be output in markdown format [...](https://...)' with a reasonable label/linktext [] . 
 You can take the path fragment or if this is incomprehenesible (e.g. a random string), use the domain name.
If there is no URL in a comment by a participant, leave the 3rd column empty.
