#### `Output is cleaned up, and the table is formatted!`

Scroll down 1 table to see the _real_, messy API output. Maybe I haven't used the API correctly. (However, OpenAI API output is much better, using the same input and the same script.)

| ---- | ---- | ---- |
|ianbutler| The author has had a long and hard time with relationships, having been in a bad relationship in college and then dealing with the end of a startup and Covid. Now, they are doing great and are ready to date. The author is content with being single, but also want to have someone in their life. The current dating scene is bad, with online dating being asymmetric for guys and low quality interactions. The author is trying to meet people through events. | - |
|cvhashim04| The author should tap into their network of friends or family to meet new people. | - |
|earlone| - | - |
|account-5| The author doesn&amp;#x27;t have time to read the article and wouldn&amp;#x27;t be single even if they were. | - |
|walterbell| The author should simply reinvent OKCupid, the way it used to be. The full right way would be a revival of OKCupid. | - |
|throwaway77384| The author was one of the people who got into online dating when it was still new and fun. The author met many interesting people, but no lasting relationships came from it. The author never been on Tinder or other online dating platforms, but it sounds like the industry has gone through the same cycle of VC-driven monetisation, removing all incentive for the platform to function correctly in the user&amp;#x27;s interest. | - |
|livinginfear| The author had a lot of success using Tinder and eventually met their wife on there. People keep implying there&amp;#x27;s some kind of hidden algorithm at play that somehow pairs you up with people who are &amp;quot;Okay, but not great&amp;quot; to keep you hooked on the app. | - |
|throwaway77384| The author&amp;#x27;s statement was too extreme, and they are sure online dating platforms will inevitably lead to people getting into relationships. The algorithm has a specific purpose, which is not &amp;quot;make the user happy&amp;quot;, but &amp;quot;keep the user engaged by any means&amp;quot;. | - |
|livinginfear| The author had seen the claim made a handful of times on Hacker News that Tinder somehow games the results to maximise engagement. The author had been waiting to refute this point. | - |
|sneak| The proposed revival of OKCupid must constitutionally prohibit selling or sharing of the question response data in a way that an acquirer cannot undo. Match group, upon buying OkCupid, ended up providing question response user data to third-parties, which caused many people to immediately delete their accounts and never trust any product from Match Group ever again. | - |
|throwaway77384| The author do wonder how much more money they made by selling information instead of just having a paid subscription model. | - |
|livinginfear| The author had considered talking to a therapist about this. | - |
|glimshe| The author&amp;#x27;s stance can be considered a mental health problem in the sense that &amp;quot;mental health&amp;quot; exists for the very survival of the species. | - |
